# Spring Boot Project

Develop REST API Spring based microservice using Boot, Data JPA and MVC

Minimal functionality:

· Develop at least 10 endpoints including CRUD operations (use request params, path variables)

· Use at least one custom Query with SQL JOIN operation

· All operations must be Transactional

· Provide 2 Boot profiles (required case: dev profile runs with in-memory H2, pro profile runs with desired database, prepare init records)

Optional functionality:

· Develop own Spring Boot autoconfiguration base on any condition property/bean/class

· Develop a scheduler to perform periodic operations over DB (for example clean outdate records)

· Develop protected admin endpoints
